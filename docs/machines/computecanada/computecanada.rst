Instructions
------------

Compute Canada already pre-builds Dedalus on demand. You can contact https://docs.computecanada.ca/wiki/Technical_support in order to request a new version. In your home::

    module purge
    module load StdEnv/2020 fftw-mpi mpi4py hdf5-mpi/1.12 python

Now build and activate the virtual environment for your installation.
You should also update pip as soon as the environment is activated::

    virtualenv --no-download python_env
    source python_env/bin/activate
    pip install --no-index --upgrade pip

Now install dedalus::

    pip install --no-index dedalus

Compute Canada recommends creating your virtual environment and loading your modules in your job scripts. For more information about doing so, please see

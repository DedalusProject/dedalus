Dedalus is a flexible framework for solving partial differential equations using spectral methods.
The code is open-source and developed by a team of researchers studying astrophysical, geophysical, and biological fluid dynamics.

Dedalus is written primarily in Python and features an easy-to-use interface with symbolic equation entry.
Our numerical algorithm produces sparse systems for a wide variety of equations and spectrally-discretized domains.
These systems are efficiently solved using compiled libraries and are automatically parallelized using MPI.

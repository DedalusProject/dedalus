About Dedalus
=============

Dedalus is a flexible framework for solving partial differential equations using spectral methods.
The code is open-source and developed by `a team of researchers <http://dedalus-project.org/community.html#developers>`_ working on problems in astrophysical and geophysical fluid dynamics.

The code is written primarily in Python and features an easy-to-use interface, including text-based equation entry.
Our numerical algorithm produces highly sparse systems for a wide variety of equations on spectrally-discretized domains.
These systems are efficiently solved using compiled libraries and multidimensional parallelization though MPI.

**Note: the master branch is currently the development head of version 2 of the codebase.
The beta release of version 3, including curvilinear domains, is on the ["d3" branch](https://github.com/DedalusProject/dedalus/tree/d3).**

Dedalus is a flexible framework for solving partial differential equations using spectral methods.
The code is open-source and developed by a team of researchers studying astrophysical and geophysical fluid dynamics.

Dedalus is written primarily in Python and features an easy-to-use interface with symbolic equation entry.
Our numerical algorithm produces sparse systems for a wide variety of equations and spectrally-discretized domains.
These systems are efficiently solved using compiled libraries and are automatically parallelized using MPI.

**Note: this branch is the development head of v2 of the codebase.
The development head of v3 of the codebase is on the ["master" branch](https://github.com/DedalusProject/dedalus/tree/master).**

Dedalus is a flexible framework for solving partial differential equations using modern spectral methods.
The code is open-source and developed by a team of researchers studying astrophysical, geophysical, and biological fluid dynamics.

Dedalus is written primarily in Python and features an easy-to-use interface with symbolic equation specification.
Our numerical algorithms produce sparse and spectrally accurate discretizations of a wide variety of PDEs.
The resulting systems are efficiently solved using compiled libraries and are automatically parallelized using MPI.
